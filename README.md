# General Assembly Project 3 Front-end
An app to for users to create contacts that they are networking with.

# Technologies
For this project, we used the MEAN stack. We also used React Router for the front end to toggle pages. We used Sass to create CSS and Parcel to create the build. For the backend, we used bcrypt to encrypt passwords, cors to control cross origin resource sharing, dotenv to manage environmental variables, Express as our backend framework, JSON Web Token to create tokens to manage sessions, and Mongoose to interact with the database. We also used an mLab MongoDB database. The front end was hosted on Netlify and the backend was hosted on Heroku.

# Approach
The app itself is a CRUD full-stack app that allows users to log on and create an account for accessing a database for their networking contacts in a GUI. The user can then create records for contacts with each record containing important information, such as name, contacts, and the details of their meeting and follow-up dates. Entries can be edited and deleted. The home page shows all contacts with key information that can be expanded for individuals.

# Unsolved problems
We would like to be able to create follow-up reminders. We also would like to make a LinkedIn integration. Finally, we would like to improve the formatting of dates.
